# Advanced Python
## Wielding the big snake to save Humanity

### Abstract
In this session we'll dive deeper into Python, covering more advanced concepts such as
decorators, generators, and context managers. With our expanded toolkit, we will build 
a simple discrete event simulation framework and an extremely accurate model of virus 
propagation that could save mankind itself.

### Prerequisites
- solid knowledge of Python basics (covered in the previous session)

### Outline
- Concepts:
  - higher-order functions
  - decorators
  - properties
  - generators
  - comprehensions
  - coroutines
  - context managers
- Discrete Event Simulation:
  - a simple simulation framework
  - modeling virus propagation
  - performance indicators
  - saving mankind
